# Contributing Guide

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

The following is a short set of guidelines for contributing to Iroha.

## How Can I Contribute?

### TL;DR

* Find Jira
* Write Tests
* `cargo test && cargo bench && cargo fmt -all && cargo clippy`
* `git pull -r origin iroha2-dev && git commit -s`

### Reporting Bugs

*Bug* is an error, design flaw, failure or fault in Iroha that causes it
to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended
ways.

Bugs are tracked as [JIRA
issues](https://jira.hyperledger.org/projects/IR/issues/IR-275?filter=allopenissues&orderby=issuetype+ASC%2C+priority+DESC%2C+updated+DESC) in Hyperledger Jira.

To submit a bug, [create new
issue](https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/CreateIssue.jspa) and
include these details:

| Field               | What to enter                                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Project             | Iroha (IR)                                           |
| Issue Type          | Bug                                                  |
| Summary             | Essence of the problem                               |
| Description         | What the issue is about; if you have any logs, please provide them |
| Priority            | You can use Medium though if you see the issue as a high priority, please choose that |
| Environment         | Your OS, device's specs, Virtual Environment if you use one, version of Iroha etc. |

### Reporting Vulnerabilities

While we try to be proactive in preventing security problems, we do not
assume they will never come up.

It is standard practice to responsibly and privately disclose to the
vendor (Hyperledger organization) a security problem before publicizing,
so a fix can be prepared, and damage from the vulnerability minimized.

Before the First Major Release (1.0) all vulnerabilities are considered
to be bugs, so feel free to submit them as described above. After the
First Major Release please utilize [a bug bounty program
here](https://hackerone.com/hyperledger) in order to submit
vulnerabilities and get your reward.

In any case of questions feel free to reach to any of existing maintainers in
Rocket.Chat private messages.

### Suggesting Improvements

An *improvement* is a code or idea, which makes **existing** code or
design faster, more stable, portable, secure or better in any other way.

Improvements are tracked as [JIRA
improvements](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/IR-184?jql=project%20%3D%20IR%20and%20issuetype%20%3D%20Improvement%20ORDER%20BY%20updated%20DESC).
To submit new improvement, [create new
issue](https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/CreateIssue.jspa) and
include these details:

| Field               | What to enter                                        |

| Description         | What the idea is about; if you have any code suggestions, you are welcome to add them here |
| Priority            | You can use Medium                                   |
| Assign              | You can assign the task to yourself if you are planning on working on it |

### Asking Questions

A **question** is any discussion that is typically neigher a bug, nor
feature request or improvement. If you have a question like "How do I do
X?" - this paragraph is for you.

Please post your question in [your favourite
messenger](#places-where-community-is-active) so members of the
community could help you. You can also help others!

### Your First Code Contribution

Read our [Rust Style Guide](#rust-style-guide) and start with
beginner-friendly issues with JIRA label
[good-first-issue](https://jira.hyperledger.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20IR%20and%20labels%20%3D%20good-first-issue%20ORDER%20BY%20updated%20DESC).
Indicate somehow that you are working on this task: get in touch with
maintainers team, community or simply assign this issue to yourself.

### Pull Requests

-  Fill in [the required template](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
-  **Write tests** for new code. Test coverage for new code must be at
   least 70% and to check coverage use `cargo tarpaulin -v`
-  Every pull request should be reviewed and **get at least two
   approvals from maintainers team**. Check who is a current maintainer
   in
   [MAINTAINERS.md](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/iroha2-dev/MAINTAINERS.md)
   file
-  When you've finished work make sure that you've got all passing CI
   checks after that **rebase and merge** your pull request
-  Follow the [Rust Style Guide](#rust-style-guide)
-  Follow the [Git Style Guide](#git-style-guide>)
-  **Document new code** based on the [Documentation
   Styleguide](#documentation-styleguide)
-  When working with **PRs from forks** check [this
   manual](https://help.github.com/articles/checking-out-pull-requests-locally)

### Tests and Benchmarks

-  To run tests execute `cargo test` command
-  To run benchmarks execute `cargo bench` command, if you want to debug output in benchmark, execute `RUSTFLAGS="--cfg debug_assertions" cargo bench` command

## Styleguides

### Git Style Guide

-  **Sign-off every commit** with [DCO](https://github.com/apps/dco):
   `Signed-off-by: $NAME <$EMAIL>`. You can do it automatically using
   `git commit -s`
-  **Use present tense** ("Add feature", not "Added feature").
-  **Use imperative mood** ("Deploy docker to..." not "Deploys docker
   to...").
-  Write meaningful commit message.
-  Limit the first line of commit message to 50 characters or less
-  First line of commit message must contain summary of work done,
   second line must contain empty line, third and other lines can
   contain list of commit changes
-  Use [Git Rebase Workflow](https://git-rebase.io/)


### Rust Style Guide

- Use `cargo fmt --all`
- Do not place code inside `mod.rs` files
- Use domain-first modules structure. For example `domain::isi::*`. Such a way 
complex uses will be easier to incude in dependent modules.
- Do not use whitespaces or empty lines inside function bodies.
- Put public methods first in your impl blocks.
- Put inner modules after `self` module content, but before `tests` module.
- Prefer to return `Result` instead of panic.
- Use `expect` with explicit error message instead of `unwrap`.

### Documentation Styleguide

-  Use `Rust Docs`
