## Hello! 

It is great that you've decided to contribute to Hyperledger Iroha by telling us more about the issue you've encountered!
The thing is that we now create and store issues only in [Hyperledger JIRA](https://jira.hyperledger.org/projects/IR) so we would kindly ask you to create your issue there. 
That way you will be able to track it in JIRA with your [LFID](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEc4JRyaAoA) account. 

Still, if it is more convenient for you to create an issue on GitHub, our Yozhik Bot will carefully transfer it to JIRA and close the issue here.
